### Heyo ðŸ‘‹
I'm an experienced endpoint and infrastructure security engineer.
I've recently discovered a strong passion for docker and automation, and am working towards developing a training environment to help assist my coworkers in various tools.




funkySwarm project to follow inspiration from work / Security-Onion and build a swarm only Network security monitoring tool, FOSS / no-cost / trial tooling only. 
I hope for it to serve multiple purposes
- training environment
-- network simulation
-- test data repositories for matching data between users
-- Tool walkthroughs and familiarization
- Multiple deployment methods
-- Multi VM
-- Single host
-- AWS Deployments
- Challenge to SecOnion (Can I fully containerize similar capabilities in a more efficient, more manageable manner?)
