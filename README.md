### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finding and mangling various containers, hoping to glue 'em together to create training for coworkers on security (container and not)

funkySwarm project to follow inspiration from work / Security-Onion and build a swarm only Network security monitoring tool, FOSS/no-cost tooling only. 
Additionally to create a playground version of funkySwarm that will simulate live networks/provide pcap upload for users to test/learn
