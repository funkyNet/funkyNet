### Heyo ðŸ‘‹
I'm an experienced endpoint and infrastructure security engineer.
I've recently discovered a strong passion for docker and automation, and am working towards developing a training environment to help assist my coworkers in various tools.




funkySwarm project to follow inspiration from work / Security-Onion and build a swarm only Network security monitoring tool, FOSS / no-cost / trial tooling only. 
I hope for it to serve multiple purposes
  - training environment
  - network simulation
  - test data repositories for matching data between users
  - Tool walkthroughs and familiarization
- Multiple deployment methods
  - Multi VM
  - Single host
  - AWS Deployments
- Challenge to SecOnion (Can I...)
  - Fully containerize similar capabilities 
  - More efficient 
  - More manageable
  - Care about host infrastructure as well
