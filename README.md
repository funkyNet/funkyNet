### Heyo ðŸ‘‹
I'm an experienced security analyst, engineer, architect!
I've discovered a strong passion for docker and automation, and am working towards developing a training environment to help assist my coworkers in various tools. Also I thought naming everything funkySomething was quite entertaining, err, funkyFun?


funkyWorld is my current pet project. The overarching goal being similar to my deprecated funkySwarm project, but at the same time, a repo for my own learning and tinkering.
Current Objectives
  - How to capture plans, notes, priority (in gitlab?)
  - Investigate K8s, KubeVirt?, how can I automate a containerized virtual environment, a 1 stop playground!
  - mimic some training material faux environments as a starter
  - Expand into standardized processes of introducing new tooling (base environment? ninite style pick 'n choose?)


funkySwarm is an old project I had attempted to make an improved Security-Onion, which of course became quite humbling followed by more focus on work.
funkySwarm project to follow inspiration from work / Security-Onion and build a swarm only Network security monitoring tool, FOSS / no-cost / trial tooling only. 
I hope for it to serve multiple purposes
  - training environment
  - network simulation
  - test data repositories for matching data between users
  - Tool walkthroughs and familiarization
- Multiple deployment methods
  - Multi VM
  - Single host
  - AWS Deployments
- Challenge to SecOnion and other FOSS NSMs (Can I...)
  - Fully containerize similar capabilities 
  - More efficient 
  - More manageable
  - Care about host infrastructure as well
